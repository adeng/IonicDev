<p>Police responded to a call Saturday morning about a man vandalizing an apartment complex in Torrance, said LAPD spokesperson Jane Kim.</p>
<p>Following a confrontation with police, the man was sent to the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center’s emergency room to be treated for injuries, she said.</p>
<p>Police took off the man’s handcuffs about 2:30 p.m., and the man grabbed a metal stool and began to swing it. Kim said an officer shot him after the man attempted to grab his gun.</p>
<p>The man was pronounced dead at the scene. His name has not yet been released.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="206" height="320" src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/Bruins.jpg" class="attachment-large wp-post-image" alt="Junior guard Isaac Hamilton led UCLA with 23 points on 9-of-12 shooting in Saturday&#039;s loss to No. 11 North Carolina. Hamilton hit his first four three-point attempts as the Bruins built an early 11-point lead in the first half.(Daily Bruin file photo)" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;"><p>UCLA had its chance, trailing No. 11 North Carolina by just three points with 9:34 to go.</p>
<p>Freshman guard Aaron Holiday had two free-throw attempts, with the opportunity to cut that lead to one point. He missed both, and the Carolina cavalcade was on.</p>
<p>North Carolina embarked on a 13-0 run after those missed free throws, removing any hope for UCLA&#8217;s third upset win in as many weeks. The Tar Heels cruised to an 89-76 victory, snapping the Bruins&#8217; five-game win streak.</p>
<p>The game really started to unravel for No. 22 UCLA (8-4) in the final stretch of the first half.</p>
<p>The Bruins led by as many as 11 points with 10:00 to go in the first period, buoyed by four 3-pointers from junior guard Isaac Hamilton. But after that initial surge, North Carolina became the aggressor, pushing the ball in transition whenever possible and attacking the basket at will. The Tar Heels (9-2) outscored the Bruins 23-12 over the final 10 minutes in the first half, and the game entered halftime deadlocked at 38-38.</p>
<p>In the second half, North Carolina kept its foot on the gas, pushing ahead to a 46-38 lead by the 18:05 mark. UCLA fought back to cut that North Carolina lead to just three points at the 9:34 mark, but the Bruins were never able to get any closer.</p>
<p>Preventing the Bruins from pulling off another upset were three things: poor transition defense, faulty defensive rebounding and turnovers. The Tar Heels had 14 fast-break points, 11 second-chance points and 24 points off turnovers. UCLA had 17 turnovers in the game, compared to just nine for North Carolina.</p>
<p>North Carolina pushed the tempo relentlessly, averaging just 12.5 seconds per possession in the second half, as UCLA struggled to get back on defense.</p>
<p>There was one stretch during the second half where the Tar Heels made 10 straight field goals without a miss, increasing their lead to 84-68 with 3:55 to go. That led UCLA coach Steve Alford into slamming his clipboard and breaking it in half on the sideline.</p>
<p>When it was all over, the Bruins allowed 51 second-half points, even though they only allowed three 3-point baskets in the period. North Carolina simply took it to UCLA, particularly on the fast break.</p>
<p>Before the season, sophomore center Thomas Welsh said one of the things UCLA needed to work on was transition defense. After Saturday&#8217;s game, it&#8217;s apparent that transition defense is still a pressing concern.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the same story for the UCLA men&#8217;s basketball team on Saturday morning: The Bruins got off to a blazing start, but cooled off a bit as the first half wore on.</p>
<p>At halftime, No. 22 UCLA (8-3) is tied with No. 11 North Carolina (8-2), 38-38, after the Bruins led by as many as 11 points with 10:45 to go in the first half.</p>
<p>The game started off much like the game against Gonzaga a week ago, with junior guard Isaac Hamilton raining in 3-pointers to start the game. Hamilton made all four of his 3-point attempts in the first six minutes, giving UCLA a 16-9 lead at the 14:38 mark of the first period. As a whole, UCLA shot 6-for-10 on 3-pointers in the first half, while North Carolina shot just 1-for-11 from distance.</p>
<p>With the Tar Heels struggling from 3-point range, they became more aggressive – both offensively and defensively – and pushed the ball in transition whenever possible. North Carolina drew 12 trips to the foul line in the first half – making nine of those free-throw attempts – and had eight transition points in the first half, as UCLA struggled to get back on defense.</p>
<p>Another problem for UCLA was turnovers. As the Tar Heels upped the pressure on the perimeter, the Bruins began to throw the ball away, committing a total of 11 turnovers in the first half. North Carolina, by comparison, only had three turnovers. UCLA freshman forward Alex Olesinski was personally responsible for three of UCLA&#8217;s 11 turnovers, throwing the ball away three times.</p>
<p>Heading into the second half, UCLA has a couple foul issues to address. Senior forward/center Tony Parker has two fouls and sophomore center Thomas Welsh has three. That duo combined for 13 points on 6-for-9 shooting and 11 rebounds in the first half, but will be limited in playing time if foul trouble persists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of California will launch a $250 million fund for innovation in the UC system, officials announced Tuesday. </p>
<p>The fund aims to connect UC campuses to outside businesses and the rest of California, said a UC spokesperson. It provides resources to enhance entrepreneurship on UC campuses and help fledgling companies coming out of the UC system thrive.</p>
<p>UC officials announced the fund will be led by entrepreneur Vivek Ranadiv&#233;, a multi-millionaire software executive and manager of the Sacramento Kings. Ranadiv&#233; will contribute 5 percent of the fund.</p>
<p>Ranadiv&#233; will independently manage the fund, build a team to attract outside capital and other investors and invest in promising companies coming out of the UC system, UC officials said.</p>
<p>UC President Janet Napolitano said in a press conference the venture fund&#8217;s main purpose is to finance the development of promising products in areas such as life sciences, technology, energy and agriculture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="620" height="421" src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/bsl-group.jpg" class="attachment-large wp-post-image" alt="The University of California sold about $25 million of its indirect holdings in private prison companies after the Afrikan Black Coalition campaigned against the investments. (Courtesy of Afrikan Black Coalition)" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;"><p>The University of California sold about $25 million of its indirect holdings in private prison companies after several student groups across the UC campaigned against the investments.</p>
<p>The UC decided to sell the holdings on Dec. 1 after meeting with a group of students from the Afrikan Black Coalition because it concluded these holdings were not a good investment for the UC, which focuses on long-term investments, said UC spokeswoman Kate Moser in an email statement.</p>
<p>Moser added the UC takes into account social, governance or environmental issues when assessing the risk of longer-term investments.</p>
<p>The Afrikan Black Coalition, which consists of student organizations for black students across UC campuses, <a href="http://afrikanblackcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Prison-Divestmen-final-resolution.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">issued a resolution</a> Thursday asking the UC to divest from the prisons.</p>
<p>The coalition said in a press release issued Nov. 30 the UC had invested $25 million in the Corrections Corporation of America and The Geo Group, two of the biggest private prison management companies in the nation.</p>
<p>“It is an ethical embarrassment and a clear disregard for black and immigrant lives for the UC to be investing hundreds of millions of dollars in private prisons and their financiers,” said Yoel Haile, political director of the coalition, in a press release.</p>
<p>Kamilah Moore, an organizer for the coalition, said in a press release she thinks the goals of the private prison industry do not align with the UC’s mission of serving the public and ensuring education for all.</p>
<p>“The goals of the private prison industry are to profit from the incarceration, labor and rehabilitative treatment of black and immigrant lives,” she said.</p>
<p>Anthony Williams, the prison divestment communications director for the coalition, said he thinks the move to divest from private prisons reflects the UC’s willingness to make decisions that are both financially stable and ethically responsible.</p>
<p>Williams added the coalition has been coordinating since August withJagdeep Singh Bachher, chief investment officer of the UC Regents, to work on ensuring the divestment.</p>
<p>“This decision is not just important for black people, as private prisons especially target communities of color, but they also target low-income-earning members of the community,&#8221; Williams said. “It is not just a race issue, but a human rights issue.”</p>
<p>In June, Columbia University became the first U.S. college to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/23/us/columbia-university-prison-divest/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">divest from private prison companies</a> in response to an active student campaign and protest.</p>
<p>The UC also announced in September it <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/09/10/uc-sells-200m-worth-of-investments-in-coal-oil-sands/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sold its $200 million of direct holdings</a> in coal and oil sand companies from the University’s endowment, pension and other funds after several student groups protested the UC’s investments.</p>
<p>The University currently manages a $98.2 billion portfolio across its pension, endowment and other working capital funds.</p>
<p>Williams added the coalition is working toward establishing a formal policy for the UC to ensure investments are socially responsible.</p>
<p>He added the coalition will try to discuss the proposal at the UC Board of Regents meeting in January.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chewie, we&#8217;re home,&#8221; he says, and so are the fans.</p>
<p>Thirty-two years have passed since the original trilogy ended with “Return of the Jedi” and 10 since “R<b></b>evenge of the Sith” ended the prequel trilogy, but &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; mania is as strong as ever. Since its announcement in 2012, &#8220;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&#8221; has been the subject of immense hype and record-breaking ticket presales. Three years later, fans are ready to see whether the film is worth its hype or just another money-grabbing disappointment preying on eager and excited fans.</p>
<p>Boy, was the wait<b> </b>worth it.</p>
<p>Directed by J.J. Abrams and written by Abrams, Michael Arndt and &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; original trilogy writer Lawrence Kasdan, “The Force Awakens” soars as a fresh take on the Star Wars universe that remains faithful to its predecessors and crushes<b> </b>memories of<b> </b>George Lucas’ abysmal prequel trilogy (Jar Jar Binks, anyone?).</p>
<p>Set 30 years after “Return of the Jedi,” the seventh installation in the series wastes no time in establishing itself as a worthy member of the Star Wars canon. The opening title crawl reveals that Luke Skywalker is missing and a war between the sinister First Order and the Rebellion has replaced the conflict between the Empire and the Rebels. Drawing from the same World War II motifs that inspired Lucas, Abrams<b> </b>crafts a Nazi-like First Order well on its way to crushing the Rebellion.</p>
<p>While the original trilogy centered around the adventures of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), Abrams establishes a new trio consisting of Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Rey (Daisy Ridley). But the film’s greatest strength is its ability to successfully integrate the old with the new as Ford, Fisher, Hamill and other members of the original trilogy reprise their roles. It feels as if Abrams is priming fans to let go of the past and embrace the future, allowing this film to serve as a changing of the guard.</p>
<p><b></b>New characters mean new nuances and refreshing tweaks to the old formula. Dameron remains devoted to the rebel cause, Finn desperately tries to find safety as he flees his former life as a Storm Trooper and Rey desperately clings to her past in the hopes that she will be reunited with her family.</p>
<p>Besides the new trio, other characters either make appearances, such as Chewbacca and C-3PO, or are replaced with new counterparts. The droid<b> </b>BB-8 is a<b> </b>robotic<b> </b>ball of fun that takes the reigns from R2-D2 and is the updated version of the droid that fans are looking for, filled with more charm, heart and personality than its predecessor. The film&#8217;s new villain Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver, professes his desire to walk in Darth Vader’s footsteps, but his inner demons and inferiority complex make him a fragile yet menacing foe. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) occupies the sinister, bonding presence once held by Emperor Palpatine. Even Yoda gets a counterpart in tiny, wise cantina owner Maz Kanata, voiced by Lupita Nyong’o.</p>
<p>“The Force Awakens” <b> </b>doesn&#8217;t offer new plot lines; it simply trudges forward but never stalls. The writers revisit familiar Star Wars tropes, such as giant space weapons, rescuing captured allies and intergalactic warfare. The film is neither boring nor stale, but is rather a return to form that follows the successful formula set up by “A New Hope,” bordering on becoming a direct remake rather than a sequel.<b> </b> Spending time on character development is exactly what Abrams&#8217; team needed to avoid recreating a bumbling Jar Jar or insufferably whiny Anakin Skywalker and succeed in crafting new <b></b>characters the audience can become invested in.</p>
<p>While the recycled story plods along, the film’s youthful energy, brought in by both its director and fresh cast, carries it through. The dizzying aerial dogfights are breathtakingly beautiful and exciting, while updated special effects grant blaster battles a<b> </b>heightened sense of danger. The film’s two lightsaber battles, though short,<b> </b>thrill through their ragged <b></b>ferocity and capture the untapped potential and untrained nature of both heroes and villains.</p>
<p>After being haunted by the prequel trilogy, the Force has awoken to excited fans and indisputable success. Although Abrams is not currently slated to work on episodes eight or nine, the film is a<b> </b> worthy successor to the franchise that will satisfy both old and new Star Wars fans. It is a love letter to one of the most iconic film franchises and takes pain to get every detail right. It is a film that reminds the world why it loves Star Wars.</p>
<p>The Force is strong with this one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="620" height="328" src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/westwoodillo2-1024x542.jpg" class="attachment-large wp-post-image" alt="Westwood Village is on the cusp of a significant revitalization – perhaps for real this time. (Zeyu Ren/Daily Bruin)" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;"><p><i>Editor&#8217;s note: Is a long slump over for the Village? </i><i>We conclude t</i><i>he Quad&#8217;s series on Westwood&#8217;s rise, decline and future by focusing on the last bit.</i></p>
<p>The concept of &#8220;bringing Westwood back&#8221; has been used so many times, it has become a cliché.</p>
<p>That is because since the 1980s, many revitalization efforts have been <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/17/local/la-me-westwood-village-20130618" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">unsuccessful</a> in bringing Westwood Village back to its former glory. These efforts include a <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/11/30/westwood-for-rent-yesterdays-plan-tomorrows-village/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">specific plan</a>, a <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/27/local/me-westwood27" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">business improvement district that went bankrupt</a> and many, many failed businesses.</p>
<p>But as we near the end of 2015, the landscape has changed. Business owners, new developers and residents are aiming to carry Westwood into a new direction.</p>
<p>For the last 15 years, Westwood has seen a surge in development that could change its image drastically. From the increase of retail options to mixed-use projects, more people will be in Westwood spending more money over the next few years.</p>
<p>Here are the signs that show a revitalization in Westwood is imminent.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/12.14.quad_.westwood.edit1-01.png" rel="attachment wp-att-245153"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-245153 size-large" src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/12.14.quad_.westwood.edit1-01-1024x611.png" alt="12.14.quad.westwood.edit1-01.png" width="620" height="369" data-uniq-id="ca9ef" /></a></p>
<p><b>More retail options</b></p>
<p>When stores come to Westwood, one should consider what value they will add. Landlords as well as potential business owners should consider what Westwood needs, or what it lacks. Ignoring this allows too many of one kind of store to open up, a <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/11/30/westwood-for-rent-yesterdays-plan-tomorrows-village/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">problem</a> <b></b>that arose in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The problem has since returned, and that&#8217;s why the <a href="http://planning.lacity.org/complan/specplan/pdf/wwdvil.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Westwood Village Specific Plan</a> should play a key role. What&#8217;s the point of having 12 restaurants that serve pizza and about as many that serve sandwiches? The plan can help increase variety in the Village by setting a limit on restaurant types. It makes for better <b></b>business. If you have the only Mexican or Indian food restaurant in the area, then you’ll have a large clientele waiting.</p>

(Daily Bruin file photo)</p></div>
<p>Store diversity is not only good for owners, but also for consumers.</p>
<p>For over 20 years, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/30/local/me-59264" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">there wasn’t a supermarket in Westwood</a>. Hard to believe, but students and mainly residents had to go out of Westwood to shop for groceries. Then Ralphs decided to <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2001/09/26/slew-of-new-stores-opens-in-we/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reopen a location on Le Conte Avenue</a> in 2001, closing the gap. Since then, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods Market have opened and been successful.</p>
<p>Target filled the spot of a department store in Westwood when it <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2012/07/30/westwood-citytarget-now-open-to-public/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opened in 2012</a>.</p>
<p>New stores and restaurants are also coming into Westwood, and this can show other potential businesses that it is a safe market. More stores have opened in the second half of 2015 than have closed. From Francesca&#8217;s and Paper Source&#8217;s <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/10/09/womens-boutique-francescas-to-open-doors-in-westwood-village/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">arrival this year</a> to Sur La Table&#8217;s <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/10/29/sur-la-table-to-spice-up-westwood-with-upscale-kitchenware-selection/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announcement</a>, we are seeing more exclusive and convenient retail showing up.</p>
<p>These new stores should cater to both students and residents, so that they won’t have to travel to another shopping center or across town to get what they need. A bookstore, for example, will appeal to students, as well as residents and other people in the area<b>.</b></p>
<p>Again, the idea of filling the gaps currently present in the Westwood market can be the key to a successful business.</p>
<p><b>New developments</b></p>
<p>Mixed-use projects right in the Village will not only add more foot traffic, but also more consumer spending. That is because these projects are aimed at high-income residents.</p>
<p>Upper-class individuals can now consider living at the <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/10/21/apartment-complex-with-le-pain-quotidien-opens-on-gayley-lindbrook/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gayley and Lindbrook Apartments</a>, a 34-unit mixed-use project. A 45-room extended-stay hotel, <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/09/08/extended-stay-luxury-hotel-nestles-way-into-westwood-village/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Plaza La Reina</a>, will cater to international visitors and tourists when it opens this month. Both projects will have restaurants on their ground floors.</p>
<p>As it looks forward with making higher-end buildings, Westwood should also continue to maintain its older buildings with the historic architecture that once helped it thrive. These buildings, distinctly Mediterranean in appearance, can make Westwood stand out in the modern era.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/04/23/westwood-village-building-to-be-restored-to-original-spanish-style/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinross and Gayley building restoration</a>, for example is expected to have a higher leasing quality after a $1 million renovation.</p>
<p>Taking this into consideration, these projects won&#8217;t have much of an impact if some spots in the Village are not well-maintained. Westwood is going to feel unevenly developed if there is a worn-out dome building on one side of a street and a multi-million dollar hotel on the other. Westwood needs consistent development and revitalization across all corners if it wants to be successful.</p>
<p><b>The Purple Line</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2012/11/20/purple-line-extended-to-west-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purple Line extension</a> to Westwood from its current terminus in Koreatown will increase accessibility and the number of visitors to the village. It would allow riders to go from downtown Los Angeles to Westwood in 30 minutes or less – that is the dream for transit obsessives like myself.</p>
<p>The project is expected to be completed by 2035. However, if Los Angeles were to win the bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, city officials would <a href="dailybruin.com/2015/09/12/metro-requests-federal-funds-for-purple-line-extension-to-westwood/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">seek additional funding</a> to finish the project before the event.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/news.metro2024.9.12.edit3-01.png" rel="attachment wp-att-245155"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-245155 " src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/news.metro2024.9.12.edit3-01.png" alt="news.metro2024.9.12.edit3-01.png" width="630" height="664" data-uniq-id="566c8" /></a></p>
<p>L.A. County Metro officials said finishing the extension earlier will reduce construction costs, cause less traffic impacts and be convenient for the 150,000 people that work around the planned train stations.</p>
<p>The Village has had a lack of parking recently, something that has dissuaded people from visiting. Having a subway at its doorstep would make Westwood more accessible for hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p><b>The Hammer Museum</b></p>
<div id="attachment_245156" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/web.oxybuilding.CreativeC.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-245156"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-245156" src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/web.oxybuilding.CreativeC-300x228.jpg" alt="web.oxybuilding.CreativeC.jpg" width="300" height="228" data-uniq-id="ba589" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(Wikipedia Creative Commons by Gary Minnaert)</p></div>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Lastly, the Hammer Museum&#8217;s recently announced expansion will only add more foot traffic to the Village.</p>
<p>The free museum, now a popular tourist attraction with an annual attendance of nearly 200,000, will <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/10/26/ucla-purchases-occidental-petroleum-building-for-more-than-92m/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">expand</a> to take up the first five floors of the building formerly owned by Occidental Petroleum.</p>
<p>Even though UCLA has been managing the museum since 1994, it is more independent than other museums funded by universities. Even then, the Hammer Museum has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-philbin18-2009oct18-story.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">become a respected museum</a> since UCLA took over.</p>
<p>When Armand Hammer, former chairman of Occidental Petroleum, founded the museum, people envisioned Westwood becoming an <a href="http://la.curbed.com/archives/2013/06/4_proposals_for_reinventing_westwood_village_as_an_artsy_hub.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">arts and culture center</a>. Though that may not be completely true today, the museum has a lot of potential. It already has hosted critically acclaimed exhibitions and has a large following, so an expansion will certainly draw more crowds.</p>
<p><b>Looking at the future</b></p>
<p>I love looking at old photos of Westwood, imagining myself in them and then comparing them to the present. And every time, I am astonished to see how much the Village has changed. Whenever I walk by Wilshire and Westwood, I tried to imagine the dirt roads they once used to be, long before the Oppenheimer Tower was built.</p>
<p>Waxing nostalgic is only fun up to a certain point, and so I begin to think about what Westwood can be. I envision crowded streets at night, plentiful store options, new buildings and a clock tower that actually works. And I think this vision, given the signs, may become true very soon.</p>

<p>The California-themed restaurant, which features a bar, outdoor patio and private rooms, will be closed for three months, said Karlee Kunkle, spokeswoman for Tavistock Restaurant Collection, which operates the restaurant.</p>
<p>Kunkle said restaurant managers felt it was time to update the restaurant&#8217;s aesthetics to reflect the changing Westwood community.</p>
<p>She added most of the renovations will focus on the restaurant&#8217;s interior, adding earth-tone colors and new textures, such as wood and copper, to the dining area. They will also remodel the restaurant&#8217;s private dining rooms to accommodate audio and visual presentations.</p>
<p>The outside patio will feature new furniture and a lounge area, according to a press release. Its new bar will also offer wine on tap.</p>
<p>Napa Valley Grille <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://dailybruin.com/2001/01/23/napa-valley-grille-takes-diner/">opened in 2001</a> to accommodate meetings, special occasions and casual dining. The renovated restaurant is expected to open in March, Kunkle said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UCLA official criticized anti-Semitic comments made by a UCLA student on Facebook in an email statement sent to the student body Wednesday.</p>
<p>Janina Montero, vice chancellor for student affairs, sent the email after a pro-Israel group on campus condemned an undergraduate student for a series of comments posted on the Facebook status of Jewish actress and UCLA alumna Mayim Bialik. </p>
<p>UCLA spokesman Ricardo Vazquez said the vice chancellor&#8217;s decision to send out emails is made on a case-by-case basis, and Montero felt this incident rose to a level that warranted the email.  </p>
<p>In the comments, the student called Jewish people &#8220;troglodyte albino monsters of cultural destruction&#8221; and &#8220;capitalist colonizers.&#8221; </p>
<p>The student did not respond to several requests for comment for this article. </p>
<p>Vazquez said the university will not pursue disciplinary action because the First Amendment protects individual&#8217;s private speech.</p>
<p>In the email statement, Montero urged students to treat others with compassion and to not stereotype other identities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hurtful and offensive comments displayed ignorance of the history and racial diversity of the Jewish people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Bigotry against the Jewish people or other groups is abhorrent and does not represent the values of UCLA or the beliefs of our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liat Menna, president of Students Supporting Israel at UCLA, the group that criticized the student&#8217;s comments, said she thinks Montero&#8217;s statement was inadequate because it did not address the issue of anti-Zionism. Zionism is the belief that Jewish people should have an independent state, such as Israel.</p>
<p>&#8220;The demonization of Jewish students on campus is directly linked to the demonization of the Zionist identity,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Vazquez said the university is working to prevent similar incidents through community collaboration initiatives, the Diversity Requirement and more accessible ways of reporting bias.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="620" height="412" src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/12/wbb.12.17.jpg" class="attachment-large wp-post-image" alt="Sophomore guard Jordin Canada posted 17 points, shooting eight for 14 from the field against the UC Irvine Anteaters on Wednesday night. (Daily Bruin file photo)" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;"><p>During the fourth quarter of the women&#8217;s basketball game, despite the team being up 35 points, Jordin Canada was bothering coach Cori Close to let her back into the game. When Close finally relented, Canada was fed a pass inside and immediately blew a wide-open layup. The sophomore guard grabbed her own rebound and dribbled back to the perimeter, trying to bite back a smile.</p>
<p>She was clearly having fun. </p>
<p>It was easy to see why she would be, as the No. 19 UCLA cruised to an 83-48 victory over UC Irvine in Pauley Pavilion on Wednesday night. The Bruins finished the game shooting 46 percent compared to the Anteaters&#8217; 28 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;re playing to our strengths and, you know, we&#8217;re playing the way we&#8217;re supposed to play, it&#8217;s definitely fun,&#8221; Canada said. &#8220;I know I had fun and I know my teammates had fun.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The game involved UCLA pushing the ball quickly in transition before UCI could react on defense. Long outlet passes proved especially effective, as the Bruins continually found players streaking to the basket after grabbing defensive rebounds. </p>
<p>&#8220;If I was a player I&#8217;d think, &#8216;It&#8217;s a lot more fun to play this way, maybe I&#8217;ll outlet better all the time,&#8217;&#8221; Close said. &#8220;But really it starts with rebounding &#8211; it&#8217;s easy to outlet when you control over 80 percent of the offense&#8217;s misses.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCLA out-rebounded its opponent 59-30, with its top three rebounders coming from the backcourt. Senior guard Nirra Fields dominated the glass, finishing with 14 rebounds, four of them offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our guard rebounding that really has made us much more consistent, and that has to become a strength,&#8221; Close said. &#8220;You look at the Pac-12, and we&#8217;ve got a lot of good guard rebounders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fields and Canada also combined for 39 points, in what is shaping out to be one of the most productive backcourts in the Pac-12. Senior forward Kacy Swain added an additional 12 points off the bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we were (in sync) the whole game, or the majority of the whole game,&#8221; Canada said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s just practicing good habits in practice and just having that chemistry, and I think that showed out on the court tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the second game back for sophomore forward Lajahna Drummer, who was out for almost a month with a leg injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m anxious to get back and do what I do best, which is rebounding, aggressiveness,&#8221; Drummer said. </p>
<p>Considered one of the better defenders on the team in full-court press situations, Drummer&#8217;s return helped the Bruins&#8217; defense pressure the Anteaters early, which led to nine first-half turnovers. </p>
<p>&#8220;Lajahna was a great boost tonight. She played under control,&#8221; Close said. &#8220;She was a great scoring punch for us &#8211; she added confidence and versatility.&#8221; </p>
<p>This was the Bruins&#8217; second victory of the week, after winning at Michigan 86-77 on Sunday. Their latest win capped off a three-game winning streak which has helped them continue to ascend in the polls.</p>
<p>&#8220;We beat a good team, pretty solidly, and controlled most of the game (against Michigan), and we have so much more to grow on,&#8221; Close said.</p>
<p>The team begins a three-game road series Friday starting with Sacramento State.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bryce Alford seems to have a knack for performing in the clutch.</p>
<p>In the first start of his UCLA career – back on Feb. 27, 2014 against Oregon – the junior guard made two 3-point jumpers in the final 33 seconds of regulation, helping the Bruins send the game to overtime.</p>
<p>Then, in the second round of the NCAA Tournament last year, Alford had 27 points on 9-for-13 shooting against Southern Methodist, with his goaltended 3-pointer acting as the game-winner.</p>
<p>Against Gonzaga this past weekend, Alford made a high-arcing left-handed floater off the glass in the final two minutes, preserving UCLA’s slim lead. He nearly had the game-clinching 3-pointer in that game too, but it got waved off by video replay.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night against Louisiana-Lafayette, Alford stepped up in crunch time once again, nailing a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer from the right wing to put No. 22 UCLA ahead by nine points with 1:50 to go. Alford’s dagger 3-pointer sealed the eventual 89-80 victory for the Bruins (8-3).</p>
<p>“One thing I think Bryce has really gotten into here in his junior year: He’s really understanding the time that we need him to make a big shot,” said coach Steve Alford. “He’s just got that sense to him and that ability (to know): ‘Hey, the team now needs me to make a shot.’”</p>
<p>Alford scored just 10 of his game-high 27 points in the second half on Tuesday night, but his lone 3-pointer of the period came at the perfect time. Louisiana-Lafayette was surging, having cut UCLA’s once-comfortable 19-point lead to just six points.</p>
<p>“We definitely took our foot of the gas,” said senior forward/center Tony Parker. “If we kept our foot on the gas, we would’ve made it way easier on ourselves.”</p>
<p>The Bruins came out of the gates surging – leading 8-0 to start the game, and 37-18 by the 6:57 mark in the first half. It didn’t look like Alford’s late-game heroics would be needed at all to ensure the victory.</p>
<p>“I thought we started really well, so I like the start,” Steve Alford said. “I think what happened is we haven’t been up 20 in a while. And I think we get up 19 or 20 and we relaxed.”</p>
<p>Louisiana-Lafayette cut UCLA’s lead to 12 points by halftime and to four points by the 10:13 mark in the second half. Ragin’ Cajuns forward Shawn Long was particularly effective, scoring 26 points against a Bruin defense that was without starting sophomore center Thomas Welsh.</p>
<p>“We prepped with Tom (guarding Long) and then Tom’s sickness hit him this morning,” Steve Alford said. “We really found out at shootaround around 10:30 (a.m.). So that made it hard (to guard Long) from that standpoint.”</p>
<p>Also missing from the game was freshman guard Prince Ali, who is day-to-day with a bone bruise in his knee.</p>
<p>Those injuries – in addition to foul trouble on junior guard Isaac Hamilton – forced junior guard Noah Allen to come to the fore in the clutch for the first time all season. Allen made a clutch 3-pointer with 10:00 to go in the second half to extend a four-point UCLA lead up to seven.</p>
<p>But that would be Allen’s only made field goal of the night. With minimal scoring from the guard positions, Bryce Alford was the one tasked with the scoring duties as the game entered crunch time. Not only did he make the 3-pointer with 1:50 to go, he also made two free throws with 24 seconds left to remove any doubt of a Bruin victory.</p>
<p>“(Knowing when to assert yourself is) something that you learn through experience,” Bryce Alford said. “I went through stretches last year where I had to figure that out. … I know when the team needs me to score and when they need me to get into (the offense).”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Jacqueline Leavitt, a professor emerita in urban planning and advocate for improved treatment of marginalized groups in urban planning, died Nov. 27 in Culver City from cancer-related complications.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jacqueline Leavitt, a professor emerita in urban planning and advocate for improved treatment of marginalized groups in urban planning, died Nov. 27 in Culver City from cancer-related complications. She was 76.</p>
<p>She taught urban planning at the UCLA <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://luskin.ucla.edu/news/school-public-affairs/memoriam-jacqueline-leavitt-1939-%E2%80%93-2015-professor-emeritus-urban-planning">Luskin School</a> of Public Affairs for 32 years and directed the UCLA Community Scholars Program from 1999 until she retired in June. The program connects chosen urban planning graduate students with labor and community leaders to research and collaborate with underserved Los Angeles communities.</p>
<p>Leavitt earned her master&#8217;s degree and Ph.D. at Columbia University and was a housing equality advocate, sometimes acting as a consultant for agencies such as the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and the New York City Housing Preservation and Development Agency.</p>
<p>Her work extended beyond housing equality to study the underrepresentation of minorities and women in urban planning and labor, among other fields. Leavitt more recently used her research to study women taxi drivers.</p>
<p>She was one of the first researchers to study the intersection between feminism and urban planning, said Marie Kennedy, an urban planning professor.</p>
<p>Kennedy, then an architect interested in New York urban planning issues, said she met Leavitt in the 1970s. Their paths crossed at a strike against Columbia University after someone released information the university was planning to expand into Harlem, a historically significant center of black culture, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of us grew away from advocacy planning to transformative planning,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the kind of planning that puts power in the hands of people who most need change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paavo Monkkonen, an urban planning assistant professor who met Leavitt when he was interviewing for his job in 2011, said Leavitt always pushed the department to focus on social justice through initiatives like the Community Scholars Program. He added he was struck by how candid she was about her passion for social justice in urban planning.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was much more concerned with the real world in her work,&#8221; Monkkonen said. &#8220;Academic success was much less important to her than changing society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kennedy said she thinks planning departments across the country are focusing more on urban planning&#8217;s technical aspects, such as identifying trends in urban growth and decay and allocating limited resources, instead of solving communities&#8217; problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jackie understood (the technical aspect) was just a tool and what you really need to do is work in the interest of people,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s being lost and I&#8217;m concerned because I think her death leaves a huge hole in the field and at UCLA.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nina Flores, an urban planning graduate student who teaches in a social justice program at CSU Long Beach, was one of Leavitt&#8217;s students.</p>
<p>She said she is inspired by how Leavitt centered her work around social justice, though she thinks the academic community sometimes perceives research focused on social justice to be less scholarly.</p>
<p>Flores continued to spend time with Leavitt after she retired in June and left UCLA, becoming a part of the network of friends Leavitt called upon when she needed help, she said.</p>
<p>Leavitt&#8217;s home was like an intellectual salon, she added. Students, fellow organizers and scholars constantly visited her to talk about topics such as how to better integrate research into activism, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Her apartment was decorated with artifacts from Leavitt&#8217;s travels, including things people had made for her or that she had made herself, Flores said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everywhere you looked, you&#8217;d be intellectually stimulated by books or a poster of something or her art,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Chris Tilly, director of the UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment and an urban planning professor, said Leavitt visited communities around the world, including some in India, Brazil, the Philippines and Switzerland, for work and leisure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every summer, she went to Switzerland to sketch,&#8221; Tilly said. &#8220;She would fly anywhere in the world to work with low-income, oppressed, marginalized people &#8211; especially if they were women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kennedy said Leavitt left behind hundreds of small sketches and paintings depicting people and places from all the countries she had visited.</p>
<p>Tilly said Leavitt was working on a book when she retired detailing her life growing up in a working-class Jewish neighborhood in New York City and her experiences navigating gender in urban planning.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had an eye for urban design, but also for beauty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She believed people who were excluded from society deserved beauty and equal access to it.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man suspected of using drugs on campus was arrested Friday after hitting a police officer in the Fowler Amphitheater near Janss Steps.</p>
<p>University police approached the man, 26, about 2:30 p.m. because they saw him and suspected he was doing drugs on campus, said UCPD spokesperson Nancy Greenstein. The man then hit a police officer after he declined to follow police instructions to stop.</p>
<p>The man is not affiliated with UCLA.</p>
<p>The man was released the next day after posting bail, according to Los Angeles Sheriff Department records.</p>

<p>Westbrook was the fourth pick of the 2008 NBA Draft after spending two years with the Bruin program. The point guard had a standout sophomore season in which he averaged 12.7 points and 4.3 rebounds, also becoming Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year and helping his team reach the Final Four. Westbrook has since spent eight seasons in the NBA with the Thunder, currently putting up 26.1 points per game. </p>

<p>            Fairbairn made 20 of 23 field goals this season, including a 60-yarder against Cal on Oct. 22, and all 44 of his extra points to record his fourth 100-point season and cement his spot as the Pac-12&#8217;s all-time leading scorer.</p>
<p>            Clark, the Bruins&#8217; lone All-Pac-12 first-teamer, anchored a depleted defense with stellar play on the defensive line. With 64 tackles and five sacks, the 6-foot-3-inch 310-pound tackle elevated his draft stock this fall and is projected by many as a first-rounder if he declares for this spring&#8217;s NFL draft.</p>

<p>The first time I saw them was walking around campus with my sister during her freshman year in Spokane six years ago.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>I thought the first guy I saw wearing one was literally the sixth man on the men&#8217;s basketball team and just happened to be especially proud of himself. My sister had to explain to me that those shirts were in fact given to the entire student section, a group known as &#8220;The Kennel.&#8221;</p>
<p>These supporters are far more than a student section – they really do comprise the team&#8217;s sixth man. From the sidelines of the McCarthey Center to the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas – home to the WCC Championships – the Kennel provides Gonzaga with a distinct edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have routines, they do like stunt things, you know I was doing one of the routines one time. That crowd is great and it&#8217;s fun to play against – it&#8217;s fun to play with. We get just as hyped when they&#8217;re going crazy,&#8221; said senior/forward Tony Parker following Saturday&#8217;s win. &#8220;They were reading my tweets to me and everything. They do their homework – that&#8217;s a good crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw my sister many times on ESPN as she and her friends jumped up and down for the 40-minute game&#8217;s entirety – a physical feat I can only experience vicariously.</p>
<p>When I arrived at UCLA, I was ready for a similar experience. I knew the storied history of John Wooden and the long list of national championships hoisted by the Bruins. I knew that this was a sports school, full of competitive athletes.</p>
<p>When I arrived on campus, the one thing I found missing was the fan base. Even as an avid basketball follower, I stopped attending Bruin games, uncomfortable in the only ever partially-filled Pauley Pavilion.</p>
<p>Last year I sat down with Bill Walton to discuss his time under Wooden for a feature I was working on. He lamented that the days he knew playing in Pauley were gone – when every seat was filled with an attentive fan ready to see his team take the court.</p>
<p>I tried to camp out for UCLA&#8217;s 2014 matchup with then-No.1 Arizona – a game that came down to a nail-biting five-point spread – but too many restrictive rules deterred me and many others, rendering the pre-game event unsuccessful. Pauley was packed to the rafters that night, but I was relegated to cheering in the nosebleeds, miles away from my fellow students.</p>
<p>In contrast, hundreds of Gonzaga students were camped out overnight leading up to the UCLA game – braving 30-degree weather and reading textbooks by lamp light. Bruins can&#8217;t manage that kind of turnout in the perpetual 70-degree temperatures of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Then again, the Kennel is incomparable in every sense. The McCarthey Center is considerably smaller than Pauley Pavilion. Gonzaga&#8217;s home court has a capacity of 6,000 compared to UCLA&#8217;s 12,829. The Kentucky game on Dec. 3 saw the Bruins&#8217; largest crowd since 2012 with 12,202. Students arrived less than an hour beforehand and the student section was only filled minutes before the game began. The Kennel arrived in full force over an hour before tipoff on Saturday.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an effortlessness to the Kennel&#8217;s performance. Every student seems to know what to do at every moment, no prompting needed. They all jump and chant and clap in perfect unison without an obvious leader. Over in Westwood, there&#8217;s an emcee forcing you into an 8-clap or a Bruin spell-out at every timeout.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s an incredible atmosphere. The fans are terrific, the student body is not just energetic the whole game, but they’re creative,&#8221; said coach Steve Alford Saturday. &#8220;That’s the way student bodies should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Kennel reaches an enviable decibel level that had me completely stressed despite the fact I was not the target of the taunts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn’t really hear each other to be honest with you,&#8221; said sophomore forward Jonah Bolden.</p>
<p>On the flip side of their fear-inducing function is the school pride infused into every syllable of every rally cry. The student section has you believing that you, too, are &#8220;GU&#8221;, even if you&#8217;ve never attended the school in your life.</p>
<p>While UCLA&#8217;s 28,000 undergrad enrollment may prevent the student body from having any singular interest, every Gonzaga student believes fervently in this basketball team.</p>
<p>Props to the Bruins for finding a way to translate that verbal abuse into fuel for their upset victory. Luckily for UCLA, its sixth man – Jonah Bolden – was on his game Saturday, because the Bruins have no honorary bench players to see them through to victory.</p>
